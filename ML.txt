DEFintion of ML
The field of study that gives computers the ablitiy to learn without being explicitly programmed
WHY ML
web search engine in google - how to rank webpages
spam/not spam email
EX
1. database mining - mine the large data sets of web click data to serve the customers better
2. Applications cant program by hand - NLP
3. Self-customizing programs - netflix product recommendation

SUPERVISED learning (Regression,Classification)
With the given dataset , can expect what the output should look like ,having the idea that there is  a relationship b/w input and output
REGRESSION - predicting results within a continuous output, meaning trying to map input variables to some continuous function
Ex- House price prediction from the sample data - right answers given as input 
CLASSIFICATION - predicting results in a discrete output, meaning trying to map input variables to discrete categories
Ex- discrete valued output (0 or 1) - Breast Cancer (malignant,benign)
UN SUPERVISED learning (Clustering,Associative memory)
With the given dataset , with little or no idea on what our results should look like, can derive structures from the data
CLUSTERING - group the data based on the feature
ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY - estimate mapping function from patient characteristics into illness based on the past patient experiences

LINEAR Regression with Multiple Variables
BELOW two algorithms used for predicting house price 
m is training data , n is number of features (house size,no of bedrooms)
Gradient Descent algorithm - need to chose alpha , need to find global optimum (where cost is less) , good for n > 100000
Normal Equation algorithm - no need for alpha and cost parameters , good for n < 10000

OCTAVE/MATLAB
eye(3) - gives 3x3 identity matrix
size(a) - gives rowsxcolumns of a matrix  (5x1 matrix)
length(a) - gives large dimension of matrix/vector (5)
pwd , cd ,ls , who (variables in the current environment) ,whos (detailed view with size/memory of variable)
clear a; (clear the variable from the environment)
a = abc(1:10) ; save hello.mat a;
save hello.txt a -ascii % save as text (ASCII)
a(3,2) - row 3 column 2 value of a matrix ; a(2,:) - every element along that row ; a([1 3],:)
a = [a,[10;11;12]]
a(:) - put all elements into a single vector ; c=[a b] or [a,b] - concatenate two matrices ; c=[a;b] - put b on bottom of a 
a.*b - element wise ; a.^2 ; 1 ./a
a' - transpose ; [value,index] = max(a) ; find(a<3) - return rows where a < 3
sum,prod,floor,ceil ;max(a,[],1) - take max per column wise
pinv(a) - inverse of a
print -dpng 'plot.png' ; subplot(1,2,1) ;axis([0.5 1 -1 1])
imagesc(a), colorbar, colormap gray;
for i=1:10, v(i)=2^i; end;
addpath('location') - will add this path to the environment

Logistic Regression & Regularization
Logistic Regression algorithm is used for Classification problem
